# Evently Backend - Design Decisions & Trade-offs

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the major design decisions, trade-offs, and architectural choices made in building the Evently backend system. The system is designed to handle high-concurrency booking scenarios while maintaining data consistency and providing excellent user experience.

## 1. Concurrency & Race Condition Handling

### **Decision: Dual-Layer Locking with Direct Processing**
**Approach**: PostgreSQL `FOR UPDATE` locks + Redis distributed locks with synchronous processing

**Rationale**:
- **No Message Queue for Bookings**: Direct processing provides immediate feedback to users
- **Dual-Layer Locking**: Database locks prevent race conditions, Redis locks provide distributed coordination
- **Seat-Level Granularity**: Individual seat locking prevents overselling at the finest level

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Immediate user feedback, prevents overselling, fine-grained locking, data consistency
- ‚ùå **Cons**: More complex locking logic
- üîÑ **Alternative Considered**: Message queue processing - rejected for poor user experience

### **Implementation Details**:
```sql
-- Atomic seat locking with row-level locking
SELECT seat_id, status FROM show_seats WHERE show_id = $1 AND seat_id = ANY($2) FOR UPDATE;
-- Combined with Redis distributed locks
SET seat_lock:${show_id}:${seat_id} ${user_id} EX 600 NX
```

## 2. Database Design & Modeling

### **Decision: Venue-Based Seat Management Architecture**
**Approach**: 7-table normalized design with individual seat tracking and show-based availability

**Rationale**:
- **Seat-Level Granularity**: Individual seats tracked for precise booking control
- **Venue Separation**: Events can have multiple shows at different venues
- **Junction Table**: `show_seats` manages seat availability per show with status tracking
- **ENUM Types**: Strong typing for statuses (booking_status, seat_status, user_role)

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Precise seat control, flexible venue management, strong data consistency
- ‚ùå **Cons**: More complex queries, higher storage overhead
- üîÑ **Alternative Considered**: Simple event capacity - rejected for lack of seat selection

### **Key Design Choices**:
- **Composite Primary Keys**: `show_seats(show_id, seat_id)` for efficient junction table operations
- **Status Tracking**: Seat states (AVAILABLE, LOCKED, BOOKED) with temporal locking
- **CASCADE DELETE**: Maintains referential integrity across all relationships
- **Strategic Indexes**: Optimized for seat selection and booking workflows

## 3. Scalability & Performance

### **Decision: Redis-Based State Management with Connection Pooling**
**Approach**: Redis for distributed locks and waiting room + PostgreSQL connection pooling

**Components**:
1. **Redis Distributed Locks**: Seat locking with 10-minute expiration
2. **Connection Pooling**: Efficient PostgreSQL connection management
3. **Strategic Indexes**: Optimized for seat selection queries
4. **Waiting Room**: Traffic throttling via Redis-backed queue

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Prevents overselling, handles concurrent access, efficient resource usage
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Redis dependency for core functionality, lock management complexity
- üîÑ **Alternative Considered**: Database-only locking - rejected for distributed coordination needs

### **Performance Optimizations**:
- **Seat Lock Caching**: Redis locks prevent double-booking without database hits
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuses PostgreSQL connections efficiently
- **Query Optimization**: Indexes on show_id, seat_id, booking_id for fast lookups
- **Batch Operations**: Multiple seat updates in single transactions

## 4. Queue System Design

### **Decision: Selective Queue Usage for Non-Blocking Operations**
**Approach**: Two queues - waiting room traffic throttling and cleanup automation

**Rationale**:
- **Waiting Room Queue**: Throttles traffic during high demand without blocking API
- **Cleanup Queue**: Automated expired booking cleanup via cron jobs
- **No Booking Queue**: Direct booking processing for immediate user feedback

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Immediate booking feedback, efficient traffic throttling, automated cleanup
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Higher API load during peaks, more complex direct processing
